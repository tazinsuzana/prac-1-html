	<p style = "color :White; font-family:Verdana; font-size: 15px;" >Agnes left Winden at some point but to Winden with Tronte in 1953, staying in the home of Doris Tiedemann and becoming romantically involved with her.

	<h3 style= "color: #E50914;font-family:Verdana; font-size: 20px;"> Martha Nielsen </h3>

<p style = "color :White; font-family:Verdana; font-size: 15px;"> Martha develops a romantic relationship with Jonas Kahnwald in June 2019, but during Jonas' extended absence from school following his father's suicide, begins dating his friend Bartosz. After Jonas return on November 4th, Martha joins Bartosz, Jonas, and her brothers Magnus and Mikkel in a late night escape to find the missing boy Erik's hidden drug cache outside the Winden Caves. Following her brother's disappearance at the cave mouth, and her being torn between Jonas and Bartosz, she becomes increasingly sorrowful in the following days.

After ignoring multiple calls from Bartosz, Martha texts Jonas on the morning of November 7th, wanting to talk with him. After performing at the school play later that night, Jonas visits Martha in the dressing room. Jonas confides in her that he was in psychiatric treatment rather than an exchange program in France as Bartosz had been telling their classmates. Jonas then asks why she contacted him rather than Bartosz that morning, and she embraces him in a kiss.</p> </section>
<section id= "Jonas Kahnwald ">
	<h4 style= "color: #E50914; font-size: 25px; font-family:Verdana;font-size: 20px;" > Jonas Kahnwald  </h4>
<p style = "color :White; font-family:Verdana; font-size: 15px;"> Michael Kahnwald was really Mikkel Nielsen, who traveled through time from 2019 to 1986 and grew up with adoptive mother Ines Kahnwald. Thus, Jonas' biological paternal grandparents are the Nielsens: Ulrich and Katharina, making Martha and Magnus his biological aunt and uncle.

In the days following Mikkel's disappearance, Jonas' true purpose is revealed: He is a time traveler who isn't aware of how significant a role he will play in the overall course of events.

As an adult, he travels through time with a complicated agenda. He is working tirelessly to undo some of the unfortunate events in Winden that he has helped to create. While he suspects he can't actually change the course of time, he hasn't given up hope. For a long time he works alongside Claudia Tiedemann in her fight against the Sic Mundus cult and their leader Adam. <p>
